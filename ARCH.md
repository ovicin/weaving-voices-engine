Architecture
============

`DRAFT`

This document is a draft on the software architecture for the Weaving Voices Engine. The design emphazise a multi-peer but yet simple and flexible design.

#### MWC Architecuture

The system takes a distributed approach to the **Model View Controller** architecure. 

The system is built of to **multiple agents** refered as **services**. Services can be either **Views** or **Controllers**. Each service have an **internal modular Model** which keeps its attributes in sync with the other services using a **subscription** based approach.

The subscription based model is based around a **publisher** which based on an **attributes dictionary** provides the services with the available attributes on the system they can **subscribe** to.

On the current implementation the publisher serves also as a publishing server pushing the notifications to the subscribed services. This is a functionalitity that can be later done distributely while keeping the publisher just as an attributes dictionary.

`Notes: Rename Services to something else?`

###Model

####Attributes dictionary

This Attributed dictionary defines the main **data model** used:

* Name
	* Unique identifier of an **attribute** offered by a **service**.
* Value
	* Current value of the **attribute**.
* Net Adress
	* Current network location for the **service** (IP Address and Port)
* Subscribers 
	* Collection of NetAdress of for the **services** registered to the **attribute**.

###Actors

####Service

Services are instances running some logic or view, they communicate using a subscription based model.

#####Attributes actions:


* **PUT:** Updates an attribute locally and remotley.

	* Properties:
		* Name
		* Value
	
	* Actions:
		* Update the **Arbiter attributes dictionary**
		* Update the **Local attributes dictionary**

* **SUBSCRIBE:** Subscribes to an attribute locally or remotley.

	* Properties:
		* Attribute Name
	
	* Actions:
		* Updates the **Subscribers** for a particular **Name** on the **Arbiter attributes dictionary** 
		* Return the current **Value** for the particular **Name**



####Publisher

The publisher is the subscription manager and updates pusher.

#####Attributes actions:

* **PUBLISH:** Pushes updates on the **Arbiter attributes dictionary** to the registered **Services**.
			
	* Trigger:
		* An update on the **Arbiter attributes dictionary**.
	
	* Actions:
		* Pushes the updates on the **Arbiter attributes dictionary** to the **Subscribers** for an specific **Attribute**.
